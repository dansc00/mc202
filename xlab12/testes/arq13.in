In comput a hash table hash map is a data struct that implem an associ array abstra data type a struct that can map keys to values A hash table uses a hash functi to comput an index also called a hash code into an array of bucket or slots from which the desire value can be found During lookup the key is hashed and the result hash indica where the corres value is stored Ideall the hash functi will assign each key to a unique bucket but most hash table design employ an imperf hash functi which might cause hash collis where the hash functi genera the same index for more than one key Such collis are always accomm in some way In a well-d hash table the averag cost number of instru for each lookup is indepe of the number of elemen stored in the table Many hash table design also allow arbitr insert and deleti of key-va pairs at amorti consta averag cost per operat In many situat hash tables turn out to be on averag more effici than search trees or any other table lookup struct For this reason they are widely used in many kinds of comput softwa partic for associ arrays databa indexi caches and sets
